\section{Coursework}

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Four assignments} (worth 60\% of the final mark)
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The assignments are worth 20\%, 20\%, 10\%, 10\% of the final mark, respectively.
		\item You have about two weeks for each assignment.
		\item You are free to discuss the assignments with other students, but do not take any (written) notes during such discussions. Everyone must write their own code, generate their own graphs, and write their own answers.
		\item These assignments (particularly the first two) are a lot of work, so start early.
	\end{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Final project} (worth 40\% of the final mark)
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Build a model of some neural system
		\item For 556 students, this can be an extension of something seen in class or something that is listed in the book.
		\item For 750 students, this must be more of a research project with more novelty.
		\item Potential ideas are collected \href{http://compneuro.uwaterloo.ca/courses/syde-750/syde-556-possible-projects.html}{here}.
		\item In any case, your project idea needs to be approved via email before Reading Week (i.e., on February 14).
		\item See \href{http://compneuro.uwaterloo.ca/courses/syde-750/syde-556-possible-projects.html}{the project page} for more information.
	\end{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Class Participation in the Seminar}  (SYDE 750 only)
	\begin{itemize}
		\item SYDE 750 students must attend the weekly seminar (Thursday, 10:30-11:20 in E5-6127).
		\item Each student is asked to submit (at least) three questions or interesting observations pertaining this week's reading, lecture notes, or the material referenced in the lecture (this should be about 100 words).
		\item Questions must be submitted via email to the instructor (\url{astoecke@uwaterloo.ca}) by midnight (23:59 EST) on the Wednesday before the seminar.
		\item This is to ensure a lively discussion in the seminar --- there are no marks for this part of the course.

\section{Things you should do to get started}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Get the textbook (\enquote{Neural Engineering}, Chris Eliasmith and Charles Anderson, 2003)
	\item Be able to run \texttt{jupyter lab} or \texttt{jupyter notebook} with a Python 3 kernel. Install \texttt{numpy}, \texttt{scipy}, and \texttt{matplotlib}. \href{https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/}{Anaconda} is a Python distribution that ships with these packets preinstalled, so (depending on your platform) this might be the easiest to use.
	\item Start thinking about a project\textellipsis already.
