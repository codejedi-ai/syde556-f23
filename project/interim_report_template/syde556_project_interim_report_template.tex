	\section*{SYDE 556/750 Project Proposal}

	\emph{Your Name -- Your Student Number}

	When proposing a project, please write a one paragraph (minimum) to one page (maximum) description of your idea. This is mainly to ensure that everyone has a clear idea of what they will be researching for the project, so I can effectively help you in case you need any support.

  This proposal will \emph{not be marked}, but failure to submit a report by\\[0.25cm]
	{\centering\bf Oct 23rd, 2022 11:59 PM EST (sharp, i.e., no late submission!)\\[0.25cm]}
	will result in a \textbf{5 mark penalty on the final grade} (this corresponds to 25\% of the final project). The proposal must be submited via email to \texttt{celiasmith@uwaterloo.ca}.

	After reading your proposal, I'd optimally have answers to the following questions in my head. However, since the proposal might not be especially well formed early on, this is not a requirement. But note that answering these questions will make for a good presentation.  Specifically:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \emph{Background:} What is your project about? What example is it an extension of or what do you plan to research?
		\item \emph{Motivation:} Why do you think that this is interesting?
		\item \emph{Plan:} What steps do you want to take to complete this project?
		\item \emph{Intermediate results (presentation only):} What have you done so far? Do you already have some results? If yes, what are the results? If no, were there any unexpected roadblocks you hit? Did questions pop up that you did not have before (what are those questions)?
	\end{itemize}

	Formatting-wise, the document you submit should approximately look like this one (12pt, 125\% line spacing, 1" border spacing, Palatino or similar font). You can find a \LaTeX\ template that you can fill out (e.g., using Overleaf) at this URL:
	\begin{center}
		\small
		\url{https://raw.githubusercontent.com/celiasmith/syde556-f22/master/project/interim_report_template/syde556_project_interim_report_template.tex}
	\end{center}

	Of course, feel free to use any word processing application of your choice, or just write text in an email.
